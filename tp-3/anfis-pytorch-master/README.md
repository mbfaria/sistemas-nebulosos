# ANFIS in pyTorch #


This is an implementation of the ANFIS system using pyTorch.


### ANFIS

ANFIS is a way of presenting a fuzzy inference system (FIS) as a
series of numeric layers so that it can be trained like a neural net.

The canonical reference is the original paper by
[Jyh-Shing Roger Jang](http://mirlab.org/jang/):

* Jang, J.-S.R. (1993). "ANFIS: adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference
  system". IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics. 23 (3):
  665â€“685. doi:10.1109/21.256541

Note that it assumes a Takagi Sugeno Kang (TSK) style of
defuzzification rather than the more usual Mamdani style.


### Background: other implementations

The original C code from Jang that implements the ANFIS system, along
with is test cases, is available from
[a repository at CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/areas/fuzzy/systems/anfis/).

The version most people seem to use is the
[ANFIS library for Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/help/fuzzy/anfis.html).
Their [documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/fuzzy/neuro-adaptive-learning-and-anfis.html) is quite helpful for understanding how ANFIS works,
even if you don't use Matlab.

There's an implementation for the R language by Cristobal Fresno and Elmer
A. Fernandez of the
[BioScience Data Mining Group](http://www.bdmg.com.ar/?page_id=176)
in Argentina (that URL seems a bit unstable).
Again, their documentation is very helpful, particularly
the "ANFIS vignette" report that comes with the distribution (I've put a
[local copy](./Anfis-vignette.pdf) here).  It
shows how to run the system using examples from Jang's paper, and gives
some of the results.

I also found a re-implementation of this R code in Python 
[anfis](https://github.com/twmeggs/anfis) by Tim Meggs that was helpful
in understanding the original R code.


### Navigation

The ANFIS framework is mainly in three files:

* [anfis.py](./anfis.py) This is where the layers of the ANFIS system
  are defined as Torch modules.

* [membership.py](./membership.py) At the moment I only have Bell and
  Gaussian membership functions, but any others will go in here too.

* [experimental.py](./experimental.py) The experimental infrastructure
  to train and test the FIS, and to plot some graphs etc.


There are then some runnable examples:

* [jang_examples.py](./jang_examples.py) these are four
  examples from Jang's paper (based partly on the details in the
  paper, and particle on the example folders in his source code
  distribution).

* [vignette_examples.py](./vignette_examples.py) these are
  three examples from the Vignette paper.  Two of these use Gaussians
  rather than Bell MFs.



### Installation

You need to install Python and PyTorch, nothing special.

I'm using
[Python 3.6.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/),
the [Anaconda 4.6.11](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution
and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) version 1.0.1.
